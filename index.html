<h2>Fruit Smash</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Attempt to keep the controls in check in order to smash all the fruit.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The game should be frustrating and difficult to control.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual games.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Hold down your pointer (mouse, finger) in order to create a stream of 'bullets' to smash the fruit.
<br>System dynamics: The input stream is slow to move and drags behind.
<br>Core mechanic: You can drag the bullet stream to smash the fruit.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
This prototype explores indirect control, something I had not done yet.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game is unique because it has a unique form of control.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You want to explode all the fruit.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is no story.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
3 minutes.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
It's non-intuitive, but try rotating the cursor in a circular motion/circles.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<br>
<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not model this game or take the game framework from any existing game or Phaser example. It ended up looking like Fruit Ninja but that was unintended (and it doesn't play like Fruit Ninja) :)
